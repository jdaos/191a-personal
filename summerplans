## Assessment
<b>What did we deliver at the end of spring quarter?</b><br>
Basic AnkiShare.com website build with a homepage login and upload/download pages for users. Users are able to register for an account, login, logout, upload files, and download any of the uploaded files. 

Functional Requirements:
+ Users can register for an account, login, and logout.
+ Users can upload files to the system.
+ Users can download files from the system.
+ The upload/download page automatically refreshes with an updated download list once a user uploads a file.

Nonfunctional Requirements:
+ Website access is restricted to registered users only.
+ Avaiable download files appear as a list of links of uploaded files.

<b>Feedback from sponsors:</b><br>
Are satisfied with the spring MVP delivery, but would like the team to implement deck category integration as soon as possible so that all uploaded deck files are organized better.<br>

<b>What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?</b>
Functional Requirements:
+ Decks will be organized by categories.
+ Users can view a deck's card as a coverflow.
+ Users can view an individual card from the deck coverflow.
+ Users can edit a card's content (front, back, tags) and the new card will be added to the database.
+ Users can edit a card's tags and the original card's tags will be edited.
+ Implement moderators.
+ Moderators will create communal decks for every category.
+ Moderators can delete cards from the communal database (all original and edited cards).
+ Moderators can add/delete cards from communal decks.
+ System will recognize similar/duplicate/redundant cards.
+ Database will automatically update with any changes (add new cards for edited cards, update tags of original cards, add new cards that were uploaded).

Nonfunctional Requirements:
+ Regular user and moderator user interfaces will be different, access-wise.
+ Website will be user-friendly.
+ Website design and easthetics will be simple and clean.
+ System will display errors to the user when appropriate (i.e. invalid user, wrong password, upload error, etc.)
